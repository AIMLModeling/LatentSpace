# LatentSpace
Latent space refers to an abstract multi-dimensional space containing feature values that we cannot interpret directly, but which encodes a meaningful internal representation of externally observed events. The latent space is simply a representation of compressed data in which similar data points are closer together in space. I plotted Latent Space on a 2D space and demonstrated how similar images are clustered in the latent space with Python model.
